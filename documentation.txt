- Linux compatibility

    - Install linux packages for sdl2:
            sdl2, sdl2_mixer, sdl2_ttf, sdl2_image
        the packages names might differ for other distributions.

    - Remove COM references from .csproj file and updet Framework to your
      version.

    - Change paths to linux paths: 
        Bootstrap.cs:63:            setupEnvironmentalVariables(baseDir + "\\" + "envar.cfg");
        Bootstrap.cs:64:            setup(baseDir + "\\" + DEFAULT_CONFIG);
        AssetManager.cs:27:         string[] bits = path.Split ("\\");

    - Change the comically large number of .Parent calls:
        Bootstrap.cs:61:            baseDir = Directory.GetParent(workDir).Parent.Parent.Parent.Parent.FullName;

    - Install/change font:
        my solution was to install the Calibri font in a Fonts folder in the
        base directory of the project.
            DisplayText.cs:177:         IntPtr font = loadFont("Fonts/calibri.ttf", size);
